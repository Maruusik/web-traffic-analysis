# web-traffic-analysis
This code provides a basic framework for building a robust web traffic analysis system. To enhance its robustness, you can incorporate additional features such as real-time data processing, advanced machine learning algorithms, integration with threat intelligence feeds, and automated incident response mechanisms. Additionally, consider deploying the system in a production environment and regularly updating it to adapt to evolving threats and traffic patterns.
